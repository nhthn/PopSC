# PopSC

PopSC is a framework to help you compose in SuperCollider, focused on pop and EDM. It provides shortcuts for common idioms like mixer channels, insert and send effects, sections, loops, transitions, and sequencing of drums and pitched instruments. The goal of PopSC is to feel like an entirely text-based DAW.
